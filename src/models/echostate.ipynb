    "#+CATEGORIES: Recurrent\n",
    "#+DESCRIPTION: The echo state network is a type of recurrent architecture that utilizes a reservoir of fixed and randomly weighted connections that remain frozen during training. Only layers outside of the reservoir are optimized. The dynamic behavior of the reservoir generates complex temporal patterns which create an echo of the input signal.\n",
