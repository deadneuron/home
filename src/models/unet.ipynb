    "#+DESCRIPTION: U-Net is widely used in various segmentation and image-to-image translation tasks. The architecture consists of a contracting path that uses convolutional and pooling layers to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that uses deconvolutional and upsampling layers to achieve localization. The architecture's unique U-shape allows it to preserve fine-grained details during upsampling and is particularly well-suited for segmenting structures with varying shapes and sizes.\n",
