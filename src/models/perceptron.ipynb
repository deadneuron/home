    "#+DESCRIPTION: Neural network research begins with the first implementation of an artificial neuron called the perceptron. The theory for the perceptron was introduced in 1943 by McCulloch and Pitts as a binary threshold classifier. The first implementation was actually intended to be a machine rather than a program. Photocells were interconnected with potentiometers that were updated during learning with electric motors.\n",

    "The model that kickstarted the deep learning revolution. Consisting of eight layers, including five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers. AlexNet was one of the first deep convolutional neural networks to achieve state-of-the-art results on ImageNet. The original implementation split the network over two independent gpus to alleviate challenges with memory at the time."
