    "Typical computer vision systems are trained to predict images from a fixed set of predetermined categories. CLIP is instead trained on a large dataset of images that are captioned with natural language taken from the internet. This is a naturally scalable approach where models can then learn a wide variety of visual concepts in images and associate them with their names.\n",

    "A contrastive learning objective involves training a model to identify correct pairing between (image, text) pairs in a batch. This multi-modal embedding space is learned by jointly training the image encoder and text encoder to maximize cosine similarity between correct pairs and minimize it for incorrect pairs. A symmetric cross entropy loss is optimized over these similarity scores."
