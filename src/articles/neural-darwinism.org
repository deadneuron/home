** Introduction

When neural darwinism was published, a leading view of cognition at the time was computationalism. In this view, the brain is essentially a powerful computer wired together in a specific way to process complex information. Outputs then are a result of taking inputs and manipulating them according to some internal states and learned programs.

Edelman argued that computationalism had some fundamental issues when it comes to development. Firstly, computationalism depends on a complicated wiring configuration in order to perform computations. This is mathematically impossible to specify with genetic code as there are something like 100 trillion neuronal connections and only 100 thousand genes in the human genome. Secondly, computationalim requires a symbolic representation to encode sensory input. These symbolic representations are built by creating and organizing categories, attributes and relationships to represent the world and objects within it. Edelman argued that none of these abstractions are inherent to any object being modeled and this problem needed to be addressed by any study of neural activity.

While the world is not amorphous and the properties of objects are describable in terms of chemistry and physics, it is clear that, at the macroscopic level, objects do not come in predefined categories, are variable in time, occur as novelties, and are re-sponded to in terms of relative adaptive value to the organism rather than of veridical descriptions.

Thus, Edelman's work on neural darwinism is a result of trying to explain how selection and categorization leads to knowledge representation in a fundamentally unlabeled world.

** Key Points

There are three main selectionist phases that occur in the brain throughout development. These phases govern how the brain creates, modifies, and connects a large and diverse population of neuronal groups.

Early in development, there is a massive proliferation of neurons and synaptic connections. Hundreds of thousands of neurons are generated each second and each of those will connect to thousands of others. Eventually this over-abundance leads to a competitive environment where billions of neurons and trillions of connections will inevitably die. The neurons and the connections remaining are fixed as they form the primary repertoire for the rest of development.

The next phase of development selects for the best neuronal groups out of the primary repertoire by modifying the synaptic connections between groups as they respond to external stimulus. The groups of neurons that perform well together are reinforced and they will be more likely to fire when similar stimulus comes through in the future. This process is ongoing throughout development and it is the mechanism behind neural plasticity.

The last selectionist process connects the neuronal groups created in the secondary repertoire with the motor ensembles that allow an organism to act in its world. These mappings are driven by behavioral reinforcement and they allow for bidirctional communication so that widely distributed neuronal groups can maintain continuity in response to stimulus.

These selective mechanisms all support the brain's fundamental ability to categorize by discriminating between the unique feature correlations between motor ensembles and sensory groups. Memory then comes from the ability to categorize associatively. Long term storage is the result of synaptic modifications of neuronal groups associated with the feature correlation maps. Learning then builds on memory at a higher level of abstraction as an organism builds models of expected value under conditions of expectancy.
