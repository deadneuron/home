                <p>These models replace the traditional recurrent and convolutional networks with a self attention mechanism that allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence to generate contextual representations.

                <p>Capsule networks were introduced to solve some of the limitations that convolutional networks have in understanding hierarchies between objects in images. These capsules use small groups of neurons that specialize in identifying various parts of an object and their spatial relationships.</p>

                <p>DenseNet builds on top of the ideas introduced in residual networks by implementing skip connections between a given layer and every other successive layer following it. Each layer receives a concatenation of all the feature maps of all the layers preceding it. This allows for learning at different levels of abstraction throughout the network.</p>

                <p>U-Net is widely used in various segmentation and image-to-image translation tasks. The architecture consists of a contracting path that uses convolutional and pooling layers to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that uses deconvolutional and upsampling layers to achieve localization. The architecture's unique U-shape allows it to preserve fine-grained details during upsampling and is particularly well-suited for segmenting structures with varying shapes and sizes.</p>
